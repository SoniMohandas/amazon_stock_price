To predict the day price direction of Amazon.com
The stock market is very complex and highly volatile. In order to be profitable, we do need to predict the price direction: whether it will be higher or lower than the price that is today. If we predict it to be higher, we might as well buy some stocks, else, we should probably sell.
Hence, in this project, binary classification models were applied whether the next day closing price will be higher than the opening price.
